{"name":"The Green Canvas","tagline":"Art evaluation analytics","body":"###Computer Science 109 Final Project - Fall 2014\r\n####Ahmed Hosny, Jili Huang, Yingyi Wang\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmedhosny/theGreenCanvas/gh-pages/images/art.png)\r\n\r\n### Background and Motivation\r\nThe team is interested in quantifying aesthetics as an extremely subjective and quality-based feature. We are all from design background and we always want to explore the middle realm between artistic evaluation and scientific statistics. How to evaluate a painting? Will there be any interesting relationships between its evaluation (in terms of price) and its pixels? Taking into consideration other factors such as artist's prominence, the project will attempt to answer questions such as: Are paintings of specific contrast tend to be evaluated higher than those with high saturation? Are paintings with sharp edges or on bigger canvases tend to sell cheaper? Focus will be on contemporary paintings as a twist on the exaggerated prices some of these pieces have reached - especially when many are comparable to children's artwork.\r\n\r\n### Project Objectives\r\nThis project aims at studying art valuation criterion with a specific focus on paintings. While the art market itself is responsible for fluctuations and trends, aesthetics plays an important role in evaluating art pieces. Image processing will be utilized to extract pixel information and attempt to correlate these with the peices' current market value. Therefore, the plan is to:\r\n1.Use data to explore trends in painting evaluation. How is information about the painting or even at the pixel level influencing evaluation?\r\n2.Develop a machine learning framework that can predict pricing. Can we develop an algorithm that can replace expert art consultants and can be used by, say, auction houses?\r\n\r\n### Data Acquisition\r\nData will be collected from two sources:\r\n1.Internet: Scrape information off websites such as http://artsalesindex.artinfo.com/asi/lots/3426445 . A Pandas dataframe will be constructed containing the columns: Artist's name, Year, Country, Painting Name, Style, Material, size, Markings and Price with time sold.\r\n2.Image of the painting itself: Use openCV and PIL libraries to add features to the dataframe such as: Face detection - tell us whether it is a portrait or not, Top dominant colors, large/small Areas of solid color, Edges, contrast, brightness, hue, saturationâ€¦\r\n\r\n###Design Overview\r\nThis will be explored in three stages:\r\n1.Explore trends by grouping by artist, location, material and so on. Which material or style cost the most? Or some interesting discovery such as which size of the drawings would be most expensive in terms of unit area. These will be based on pandas dataframe manipulation and grouping. We will also attempt to reduce dimentionality of the data and explore the principal components.\r\n2.After pixel information is added to the dataframe, stage one will be repeated to explore additional trends\r\n3.Build a ML model that is able to predict value. Explore different ML techniques learned in class and which is more appropriate for our application. Which feature is most influential on the evaluation?\r\n\r\n###Data Scraping\r\n####Source\r\nTo construct our database for analysis. We looked into the [Blouin art sales index website](http://artsalesindex.artinfo.com/asi/security/landing-page.ai), which has over 5 million auction records for modern paintings.\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmedhosny/theGreenCanvas/gh-pages/images/front page.jpg)\r\n\r\n####Part 1 Create Dataframe\r\nTo get access to information about each paintings, we actually make a 3-step subsequent query using beautifulsoup\r\n#####step 1\r\nUsing artists' name (alphabet order) - Take 'A' as an example, the url 'http://artsalesindex.artinfo.com/asi/search/artistsAtoZ.ai?lastName=A&startRowNum=' allows access to the artist's paintings. From here we create a list of all url's to their works.\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmedhosny/theGreenCanvas/gh-pages/images/dataScraping Page1.jpg)\r\n\r\n#####step 2: \r\nFrom each of the url above we come to the booklet of each artists. Here we collect the url's to each individual paintings.\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmedhosny/theGreenCanvas/gh-pages/images/dataScraping Page2.jpg)\r\n\r\n#####step 3: \r\nFinally we have arrive to the info page for each of these artworks. We create our dataframe from these pages.\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmedhosny/theGreenCanvas/gh-pages/images/dataScraping Page3.jpg)\r\n\r\n####Part 2 Data joining and cleaning\r\nFrom the dataframe we notice there is some inconsistency and missing fields. Our next step is to join the data set and filter out missing field data. The dataframe looks something like this.\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmedhosny/theGreenCanvas/gh-pages/images/0DATAFRAME.png)\r\n\r\n###Image processing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmedhosny/theGreenCanvas/gh-pages/images/01Sample.png)\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmedhosny/theGreenCanvas/gh-pages/images/02Major Colors.png)\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmedhosny/theGreenCanvas/gh-pages/images/03RGB.png)\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmedhosny/theGreenCanvas/gh-pages/images/04GrayScale.png)\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmedhosny/theGreenCanvas/gh-pages/images/05Thresheld.png)\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmedhosny/theGreenCanvas/gh-pages/images/06brightness.png)\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmedhosny/theGreenCanvas/gh-pages/images/07CornerDetection.png)\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmedhosny/theGreenCanvas/gh-pages/images/08Edge Detection.png)\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmedhosny/theGreenCanvas/gh-pages/images/09FaceDetection.png)\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmedhosny/theGreenCanvas/gh-pages/images/10DataWithImageProcessing.png)\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmedhosny/theGreenCanvas/gh-pages/images/12PricePerYearwihAndy.png)\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmedhosny/theGreenCanvas/gh-pages/images/13PricePerYearwihoutAndy.png)\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmedhosny/theGreenCanvas/gh-pages/images/14PricePerDominantColorsCombine.png)\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmedhosny/theGreenCanvas/gh-pages/images/15CornerPercentageGroupby.png)\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmedhosny/theGreenCanvas/gh-pages/images/17CornerPercentageArtist.png)\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmedhosny/theGreenCanvas/gh-pages/images/18famousPart (1).png)\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmedhosny/theGreenCanvas/gh-pages/images/19famousPart (2).png)\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmedhosny/theGreenCanvas/gh-pages/images/21Correlation.png)\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmedhosny/theGreenCanvas/gh-pages/images/23finalmachinelearning.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
